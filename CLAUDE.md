## TOP PRIORITY: Binary Fidelity

**The same firmware ELF that runs on a real MCU must run unmodified in VirtMCU.**

This is the non-negotiable design constraint from which everything else follows:
- No virtmcu-specific startup code, linker sections, or compile-time flags in firmware.
- Peripherals mapped at the **exact** base addresses the real MCU datasheet specifies.
- Register layouts, reset values, and interrupt numbers must match physical silicon.
- \`zenoh-clock\` and all co-simulation infrastructure are **invisible to the firmware** — they operate at the QEMU level with no guest MMIO exposure.

Any feature that requires firmware modification to work in VirtMCU is a bug in VirtMCU, not a firmware problem. See [ADR-006](docs/ADR-006-binary-fidelity.md) for the full rationale and enforcement rules.

## What This Project Is

**virtmcu** is a **deterministic multi-node firmware simulation framework** built on QEMU.
Specifically, it provides:
1. **Dynamic QOM device plugins** (.so shared libraries).
2. **arm-generic-fdt machine** — ARM machines defined by Device Tree.
3. **Native Zenoh QOM plugin** (\`hw/zenoh/\`) — deterministic clock and I/O.
4. **yaml2qemu** — Parses OpenUSD-aligned YAML and emits \`.dtb\` + CLI.

---

## Clock Synchronization Model

All clock behaviour is controlled by \`zenoh-clock\`:

| Mode | How to invoke | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| \`standalone\` | No \`-device zenoh-clock\` | Rapid development, logic testing. |
| \`slaved-suspend\` | \`-device zenoh-clock,mode=slaved-suspend\` | **Default.** Deterministic co-simulation. |
| \`slaved-icount\` | Same + \`-icount shift=0,align=off,sleep=off\` | Sub-quantum timing precision (PWM, µs). |

### Error Codes (sim/clock/advance/{id} Reply)
- \`0\` (OK): Quantum completed successfully.
- \`1\` (STALL): QEMU failed to reach TB boundary within the stall timeout (default **5 s**; set `stall-timeout=<ms>` on the device — CI uses 60 000 ms via `VIRTMCU_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS`).
- \`2\` (ZENOH_ERROR): Transport layer failure.

---

## Timing Model and Constraints

### 1. MMIO Socket Blocking
When using \`mmio-socket-bridge\`, every MMIO read/write blocks the QEMU TCG thread in a synchronous socket syscall.
- **CPU State**: The emulated CPU is **Halted** while waiting for the server.
- **icount Advancement**: Virtual time does NOT advance while blocked in a bridge call.
- **Latency Impact**: High bridge latency can cause clock stalls. Ensure the socket server is performant.

### 2. WFI (Wait For Interrupt) behavior
- In \`slaved-suspend\`, virtual time advances while the CPU is in WFI.
- The next quantum boundary will still trigger a clock-halt even if the CPU is idling.
- **Best Practice**: Use ARM Generic Timer interrupts at 100Hz rather than tight polling loops for control.

---

## Key Constraints

- **MMIO Delivery**: \`mmio-socket-bridge\` delivers **relative offsets** to the socket. External models should NOT include the base address in their match logic.
- **DTB Validation**: \`yaml2qemu\` validates that every peripheral defined in YAML is correctly mapped in the output DTB. If a mapping is missing, build will fail.
- **SysBus Mapping**: Devices added via \`-device\` only (not in YAML) are **NOT mapped** into guest memory. They will cause Data Aborts.

---

## Development Efficiency

- **Avoid Redundant `make setup`**: Only run `make setup` for the initial environment setup or if QEMU dependencies change. It applies core patches that can trigger massive rebuilds.
- **Use `make build` for Incremental Changes**: For standard changes to `hw/` peripherals, `make build` is sufficient and much faster.
- **Targeted Ninja Builds**: For the fastest turnaround when working on a specific peripheral, run ninja directly on the module target:
  `ninja -C third_party/qemu/build-virtmcu hw-virtmcu-<name>.so`
- **Pre-installed QEMU**: In many environments, QEMU is pre-installed at `/opt/virtmcu`. You only need to build if you are modifying the emulator or its peripheral plugins.

## Dependency & Version Control

- **Centralized Versions**: Agents MUST adhere to the versions defined in the `VERSIONS` file for QEMU, Zenoh, and other core dependencies.
- **Verification**: Before suggesting or implementing upgrades, verify the current pinned versions in `VERSIONS` and `requirements.txt`.
- **Package Management**: Prefer `uv` (e.g., `uv pip`, `uv run`) over standard `pip` or system package managers for all Python package management and tool installations (like CMake) due to its speed and conflict resolution.

## Language Selection Policy (ADR-013)

| Component | Language | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sim Loop** | **Rust** (Pref) / **C** | **NATIVE ONLY.** No Python bridges. |
| **Physics/SystemC** | **C++** | Standard for TLM-2.0 / MuJoCo. |
| **Tooling/Parsing** | **Python** | Out-of-band only. |
| **Telemetry** | **Rust** | Direct FlatBuffers/Zenoh integration. |

**Banned:** Python in the hot simulation loop (MMIO/Clock/Netdev).
**Recommended:** Migrate `hw/zenoh/*.c` to native Rust (Phase 18) to eliminate `zenoh-c` FFI.

---

## Production Engineering Mandates

To ensure the highest level of professional software engineering, all agents MUST adhere to these standards:

### 1. Environment Agnosticism (Zero Hardcoded Paths)
- **NO absolute paths** (e.g., `/Users/marcin/...`) or user-specific home directory references.
- Use **relative paths** based on the project root or the current file's location.
- Use platform-appropriate path joining (e.g., `os.path.join` in Python, `path::PathBuf` in Rust, `std::filesystem` in C++).
- Leverage environment variables for system-specific configuration.

### 2. Explicit Constants (NEVER Use Magic Numbers!)
- **BANNED:** Inline literal numbers or "magic numbers" in the code.
- **REQUIRED:** If a number needs to be entered (e.g., `1024`), you MUST create a `const` descriptive variable with a comment explaining what it is and why it has that value, and then use that variable.
- Example: Instead of `buffer = [0; 1024]`, do:
  ```rust
  /// Standard payload size for the bridge
  const MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE: usize = 1024;
  let buffer = [0; MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE];
  ```
- Group related constants in configuration files or dedicated `constants` modules.

### 3. Verification & TDD (The "Beyonce Rule")
- **Prove-It Pattern:** For every bug fix, you MUST write a failing test that reproduces the bug BEFORE implementing the fix.
- **Incremental Implementation:** Every feature or change must include corresponding unit or integration tests.
- **Surgical Edits:** Keep changes focused. A single logical change per commit/PR. Separate refactoring from behavior changes.

### 4. Quality & Security Gates
- **Multi-Axis Review:** Evaluate every change for Correctness, Readability, Architecture, Security, and Performance.
- **Zero Secrets:** Never hardcode or commit API keys, passwords, or sensitive credentials. Use `.env` files (excluded from git) or secret managers.
- **Input Validation:** Treat all data from external sources (Zenoh, sockets, files, guest MMIO) as untrusted. Validate at the system boundary (e.g., check MMIO write sizes, validate YAML schemas).
- **No N+1 Patterns:** Ensure data fetching (if any) uses batching or joins. Avoid unbounded loops over external resources.

### 5. Shipping & Reliability
- **Rollback Readiness:** Every deployment-impacting change should consider how it can be reverted.
- **Observability:** Ensure critical paths (sim loop, clock sync) have appropriate logging (not in hot loop), error reporting, and health checks.
- **Documentation:** Update READMEs, ADRs, and API docs as the architecture evolves.

### 6. Protected Files
- **DO NOT** automatically edit `.env` or `VERSIONS` files. These files contain specific version pins and local secrets (via symlinking) that should only be modified by the user or dedicated synchronization scripts (e.g., `make sync-versions`).

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Stale Simulation Processes (Multiple QEMU Instances)
During development, you may encounter "stale" or orphaned QEMU or Zenoh processes. These processes can hold onto ports, UNIX sockets, or CPU resources, causing subsequent runs to fail with "Address already in use" or mysterious timeouts.

**The Fix:** Manually terminate any lingering processes or use the project cleanup script:
```bash
make clean-sim
# or
bash scripts/cleanup-sim.sh
```
*Note: Stale process interference is the #1 cause of "it passes locally but fails next time" bugs.*

### Interactive QEMU Debugging
If a node hangs or fails to boot, run it interactively to see the firmware's console output.
- **Action**: Run the `run.sh` command without `-monitor none` or `-serial file:...` and use `-nographic`.
- **Exit**: To exit an interactive QEMU session, press `Ctrl+A` followed by `X`.

### SysBus Mapping vs. `-device`
In the `arm-generic-fdt` machine, a device added via `-device` is NOT automatically mapped into guest memory. 
- **The Cause**: Mapping only occurs if a corresponding node exists in the Device Tree (DTB) with a `reg` property.
- **The Fix**: Always declare peripherals in the board YAML files. The `yaml2qemu.py` tool handles the mapping.

### MMIO Offset Contract
The `mmio-socket-bridge` delivers **region-relative offsets**, not absolute physical addresses. 
- **Example**: If a bridge is at `0x10000000` and the guest reads `0x10000004`, the bridge receives `0x04`.
- **Requirement**: Your MMIO adapter/model must handle these offsets directly without adding the base address.

### "Works on My Machine" (Local vs. CI Drift)
If a fix passes locally but fails in CI, it's often due to manual edits in `third_party/qemu` or untracked files that aren't part of the automated patch mechanism.
- **The Rule**: If CI cannot reproduce your local setup from `git clone` + `make setup`, your fix is not complete.
- **The Check**: Always run `git status` after a debugging session to ensure all changes are tracked.

---

## Before Every Commit — Mandatory Lint Gate

To ensure CI remains green and Rust code follows project standards, you MUST run the linting suite before every commit:

```bash
make lint     # Runs ruff, version checks, and cargo clippy (fails loudly)
```

**Pre-commit Hook**: A git `pre-commit` hook is installed that runs `make lint` automatically. If it fails, the commit will be blocked. Fix all lint/clippy errors before attempting to commit again.

---

## CI/CD Troubleshooting & "Make CI Green" Workflow

When instructed to "fix CI", "make CI green", or address pipeline failures, you MUST follow this autonomous loop until success:

1. **Diagnose Remotely:** Use the GitHub CLI (`gh run list`, `gh run view --log`) to identify the exact failure. Always use `gh` to avoid GitHub API rate limits.
2. **Reproduce Locally:** BEFORE making code changes, run the corresponding test locally to reproduce the error.
3. **Align Local with Remote (Crucial):** If the step fails in CI but passes locally, DO NOT fix the code yet. First, modify the local test scripts, `Makefile`, or environment to ensure the failure reproduces locally. **Our local tests must catch what CI catches.**
4. **Fix & Verify:** Implement the fix and verify it passes the newly aligned local test suite.
5. **Push:** Commit and push the changes.
6. **Monitor & Loop:** Autonomously monitor the new CI run (e.g., using `gh run watch`). If it fails, immediately restart this loop. Do not stop or prompt the user until all checks are officially green.

---

## Local CI Loop Workflow (The "Local Green" Loop)

When asked to **"Fix CI locally"**, **"Run CI loop"**, or **"Make it pass"**, you MUST enter this autonomous loop:

1. **Identify Pipeline:** Determine the full suite of local validation commands (e.g., `make lint`, `make build`, `make test`).
2. **Execute & Diagnose:** Run the entire suite. Capture all failures (lint errors, build breaks, test regressions).
3. **Surgical Fix:** Address the first failure.
4. **Commit:** Once a fix is verified locally, commit the changes with a descriptive message (**DO NOT push**).
5. **Iterate:** Repeat steps 2-4 until the *entire* suite passes.
6. **Final Report:** Once all checks are green, report the major findings and fixes. Do not stop until the pipeline is fully passing.

---

## Test Coverage Loop Workflow (The "Coverage" Loop)

When asked to **"Increase coverage"** or **"Improve test coverage"**, you MUST enter this autonomous loop:

1. **Baseline:** Run the coverage tool (e.g., `make coverage` or `pytest --cov`) to identify current gaps.
2. **Targeting:** Identify the most critical untested paths (e.g., error handling, boundary conditions).
3. **Implement Tests:** Write new tests specifically targeting the identified gaps.
4. **Verify:** Run coverage again to confirm the increase. Ensure no existing tests were broken.
5. **Commit:** Commit the new tests and any necessary code changes.
6. **Iterate:** Repeat until the coverage goal is met or there are no more obvious improvements to be made.

---

## Note to Developers: Invoking Autonomous Loops

To trigger these workflows, use direct commands:
- *"Fix CI locally and commit."*
- *"Run the local CI loop until everything passes."*
- *"Increase code coverage for the physics module."*
- *"Keep fixing CI locally, don't stop until all lints and tests pass."*
