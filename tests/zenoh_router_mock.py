"""
Zenoh mock router for TCP connectivity testing.

Listens on tcp/127.0.0.1:7447 with multicast scouting disabled.  QEMU must
connect via `-device zenoh-clock,router=tcp/127.0.0.1:7447,...`.  Once QEMU
registers the sim/clock/advance/0 queryable, the mock completes one full
clock-advance handshake and exits 0.

Multicast is explicitly disabled so the test fails if QEMU ignores the
router= property and falls back to multicast peer discovery.
