# qenode

**Make QEMU behave like Renode** — dynamic device loading, FDT-based ARM machine
instantiation, platform description parsing, and Robot Framework test parity.

Part of the **FirmwareStudio** digital twin platform, where MuJoCo physics drives
the simulation clock and QEMU runs firmware in lockstep with the physical world.

---

## The Problem

[Renode](https://renode.io/) is excellent for embedded systems testing: hardware
descriptions live in text files, peripherals hot-plug without recompilation, and the
Robot Framework integration is first-class. QEMU is faster and more widely adopted,
but traditionally requires recompiling the emulator to add devices and uses hardcoded C
structs for machine definitions.

This project closes that gap.

---

## Architecture in One Paragraph

We run **QEMU 11.0.0-rc2** augmented with the **arm-generic-fdt** patch series, which
adds a new ARM machine type that instantiates CPUs, memory, and peripherals entirely
from a Device Tree blob at runtime. Our **`repl2qemu`** Python tool compiles Renode
`.repl` platform files into that Device Tree. Custom peripheral models are compiled as
**shared libraries** from C (or Rust), integrated into QEMU's Meson build via a source
symlink so `-device mydevice` discovers them automatically. A **QMP-backed Robot
Framework library** replaces Renode's test keywords. When running inside FirmwareStudio,
QEMU advances virtual time only when MuJoCo grants it a clock quantum — keeping firmware
and physics causally consistent.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full technical deep-dive,
including the timing design, prior art (qbox, MINRES), and SystemC integration paths.

## Where to Start

**Understanding the project**: Read [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
Sections 2–3 cover QEMU vs Renode and the four implementation pillars.
Section 7 covers the MuJoCo time master design. Section 8 covers prior art.

**Writing a new peripheral**: Copy `hw/dummy/dummy.c`, rename, implement MMIO ops.
Add an entry in `hw/meson.build`. Run `make build` then:
```bash
./scripts/run.sh -device your-device-name -M arm-generic-fdt -nographic
```

**Running the repl2qemu tool**:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m tools.repl2qemu path/to/board.repl --out-dtb board.dtb --print-cmd
```

**Running with FirmwareStudio** (external clock, Phase 7+):

The clock synchronization is handled by the native Zenoh QOM plugin (`hw/zenoh/`) which
compiles into QEMU. No separate Python agent process is needed. The TimeAuthority (running
in the MuJoCo container) connects directly to QEMU over Zenoh:
```bash
# slaved-suspend (default — full TCG speed, ~95% throughput)
./scripts/run.sh -M arm-generic-fdt -hw-dtb board.dtb -kernel firmware.elf \
    -device zenoh-clock,node=0,router=tcp/localhost:7447

# slaved-icount (exact ns precision — only for sub-quantum hardware timer firmware)
./scripts/run.sh -M arm-generic-fdt -hw-dtb board.dtb -kernel firmware.elf \
    -device zenoh-clock,node=0,router=tcp/localhost:7447,mode=icount \
    -icount shift=0,align=off,sleep=off
```

**Docker (CI or Phase 4+ with TCG plugins)**:
```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

---

## Prerequisites

**macOS and Linux** are both supported for development. Windows is not.

On macOS, native builds work for Phases 1–3. For Phase 4+ (TCG plugins for coverage and
tracing), use Docker — macOS has a conflict between `--enable-modules` and
`--enable-plugins` that breaks module loading (GitLab #516). See
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §6` for the full decision table.

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install ninja meson dtc pkg-config glib pixman b4

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install build-essential libglib2.0-dev ninja-build python3-venv \
                 device-tree-compiler flex bison libpixman-1-dev pkg-config b4

# All platforms
make setup        # clone QEMU, apply patches, build (~5 min first run)
make venv         # create .venv and install Python deps
source .venv/bin/activate
make run          # smoke-test
```

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Meson integration, not LD_PRELOAD**: `hw/` is symlinked into QEMU's source tree so
  devices compile as proper QEMU modules with auto-discovery. `-device foo` just works.
- **No Python in the simulation loop**: All peripherals, clock sync, and networking are
  native C/Rust QOM modules. Python is offline-only (repl2qemu, pytest). See ADR-003.
- **Three clock modes**: `standalone` (full speed; KVM/hvf available for Cortex-A on ARM
  hosts), `slaved-suspend` (native TCG hook, ~95% speed, recommended for FirmwareStudio),
  `slaved-icount` (exact ns, ~15% speed, sub-quantum timers only). Implemented as
  `hw/zenoh/zenoh-clock.c`. KVM/hvf prohibited in slaved modes and for Cortex-M. See
  ADR-001 and ADR-009.
- **Deterministic multi-node**: `hw/zenoh/zenoh-netdev.c` with virtual-timestamped frames,
  not UDP multicast. See ADR-002.
- **`query-cpus-fast`**: The old `query-cpus` QMP command is deprecated.
- **arm-generic-fdt is not upstream**: 33-patch patchew series on QEMU 11.0.0-rc2.
- **SystemC peripherals**: Path B (Remote Port, Phase 5) is primary. Path A requires
  writing `hw/misc/mmio-socket-bridge.c` first — QEMU does not natively serialize MMIO
  to sockets. See ADR-005 and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §9`.
