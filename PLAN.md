# virtmcu Active Implementation Plan

**Goal**: Make QEMU behave like Renode — dynamic device loading, FDT-based ARM machine instantiation, and deterministic multi-node simulation.
**Primary Focus**: Binary Fidelity — unmodified firmware ELFs must run in VirtMCU as they would on real hardware.

## 1. General Guidelines & Mandates

### Phase Lifecycle
Once a Phase is completed and verified, it MUST be moved from `PLAN.md` to the `/docs/COMPLETED_PHASES.md` file to maintain a clean roadmap and a clear historical record.

### Educational Content (Tutorials)
For every completed phase, a corresponding tutorial lesson MUST be added in `/tutorial`.
- **Target**: CS graduate students and engineers.
- **Style**: Explain terminology, provide reproducible code, and teach practical debugging skills.

### Regression Testing
For every completed phase, an automated integration test MUST be added to `tests/` or `test/`.
- **Bifurcated Testing**: 
  - **White-Box (Rust)**: Use `cargo test` for internal state, memory layouts, and protocol parsing.
  - **Black-Box (Python)**: Use `pytest` for multi-process orchestration (QEMU + Zenoh + TimeAuthority).
  - **Thin CI Wrappers (Bash)**: Bash scripts should only be 2-3 lines calling `pytest` or `cargo test`.

### Production Engineering Mandates
- **Environment Agnosticism**: No hardcoded paths. Use `tmp_path` for artifacts.
- **Explicit Constants**: No magic numbers. Use descriptive `const` variables.
- **The Beyonce Rule**: "If you liked it, you shoulda put a test on it." Prove bugs with failing tests before fixing.
- **Lint Gate**: `make lint` must pass before every commit (ruff, version checks, cargo clippy).

## 2. P0: Immediate Actions (Fixes & Hardening)

### **CRITICAL: Fix Main Branch Test Failures**
**Goal**: Restore the `main` branch to a fully green state.
1. **Diagnose**: Identify all failing tests in current CI and local `make ci-full`.
2. **Isolate**: Determine if failures are due to recent changes, environmental drift, or race conditions.
3. **Fix**: Apply surgical fixes to restore stability. **This is the top priority before any new feature work.**

### Restore Full Parallel Execution
**Goal**: Enable `pytest -n auto` without resource contention.
1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Ensure UNIX sockets (QMP, UART) and Zenoh topics use dynamic ports/UUIDs.
2. **Artifact Isolation**: Use `tmp_path` for all generated DTBs, ELFs, and linker scripts.
3. **Zenoh Topic Isolation**: Use unique UUID prefixes for *every* test run.
4. **Remove `xdist_group(name="serial")`**: Once stable, remove all serial markers.

## 4. Technical Debt & Future Risks

| ID | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | `arm-generic-fdt` patch drift | Strictly pin QEMU version; track upstream `accel/tcg` changes. |
| R7 | `icount` performance | Only use `slaved-icount` when sub-quantum precision is mandatory. |
| R11 | Zenoh session deadlocks | Implement non-blocking shutdown in `virtmcu-zenoh` helper. |
| R14 | High MTU WiFi/Eth latency | Use lock-free MPSC channels for packet injection. |

## 5. Permanently Rejected / Won't Do
- Python-in-the-loop for clock sync (ADR-001).
- Windows Native Support (QEMU module loading issues).
- Generic "virtmcu-only" hardware interfaces (Violates ADR-006 Binary Fidelity).
