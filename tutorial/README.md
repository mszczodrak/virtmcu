# virtmcu Tutorials

Welcome to the **virtmcu** educational series. This folder contains hands-on tutorials designed for computer science graduate students, researchers, and engineers who want to understand the internals of machine emulation, dynamic hardware construction, and bare-metal firmware execution.

## Motivation

Standard hardware emulators like QEMU are incredibly fast but relatively rigid: modifying a simulated motherboard to add a new sensor usually requires writing C code and recompiling the emulator. Frameworks like Renode are highly flexible (using text-based `.repl` files to wire up hardware dynamically) but sacrifice performance due to cross-language (C to C#) boundaries.

**virtmcu** bridges this gap. We are modifying QEMU to be completely dynamic while retaining its native C/TCG execution speed. 

## Curriculum

*   **[Lesson 1: Dynamic Machines, Device Trees, and Bare-Metal Debugging](./lesson1-dynamic-machines/README.md)**
    Learn how to construct a virtual ARM machine from a text file, write bare-metal assembly to interact with Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO), and use GDB to inspect the CPU state at the instruction level.

*   **[Lesson 2: Dynamic QOM Plugins](./lesson2-dynamic-plugins/README.md)**
    Learn how to add entirely new peripheral devices to QEMU *without* modifying the core emulator source code by leveraging the QEMU Object Model (QOM) and dynamic shared libraries in C and Rust.

*   **[Lesson 3: Parsing Platform Descriptions (.repl) to Device Trees](./lesson3-repl2qemu/README.md)**
    Discover how to translate high-level hardware description files (like Renode's `.repl` and OpenUSD-aligned YAML) into standardized Device Tree Blobs that QEMU can boot from directly.

*   **[Lesson 4: Emulation Test Automation with QMP and Pytest](./lesson4-emulation-automation/README.md)**
    Learn how to automate the testing of your firmware and virtual hardware using the QEMU Machine Protocol (QMP), Python `asyncio`, and Robot Framework keywords.

*   **[Lesson 5: Hardware Co-Simulation — Connecting SystemC Models to QEMU](./lesson5-cosimulation/README.md)**
    Extend QEMU's MMIO subsystem to communicate with an external hardware model — specifically a SystemC TLM-2.0 register file — over a Unix domain socket.

*   **[Lesson 6: Deterministic Multi-Node Networking](./lesson6-multi-node/README.md)**
    Explore how virtmcu handles multi-node coordination with absolute determinism, replacing the traditional `WirelessMedium` typically found in Renode, and allowing multiple independent QEMU instances to communicate reliably without losing deterministic execution.

*   **[Lesson 7: Zenoh Clock: Deterministic Co-simulation Time Synchronization](./lesson7-zenoh-clock/README.md)**
    Understand how QEMU can run as a **time slave** to an external physics simulation (like MuJoCo) using the native Zenoh clock plugin (`zenoh-clock`) to enforce causal correctness.

*   **[Lesson 8: Deterministic Multi-Node UART](./lesson8-interactive-uart/README.md)**
    Explore how `zenoh-chardev` extends the virtual-timestamp model to serial ports, enabling deterministic multi-node UART communication and human-in-the-loop interactivity.

*   **[Lesson 9: Advanced Co-Simulation (SystemC CAN)](./lesson9-systemc-can/README.md)**
    Learn how to build a complex, multi-threaded SystemC adapter that translates Zenoh network messages into TLM-2.0 transactions for a simulated CAN controller and shared physical medium.

*   **[Lesson 10: The Cyber-Physical Bridge (SAL/AAL)](./lesson10-sal-aal/README.md)**
    Discover the Sensor/Actuator Abstraction Layer (SAL/AAL), which translates between the binary register world of firmware and the continuous physical properties of a physics simulation or prerecorded data stream (RESD).

*   **[Lesson 11: RISC-V Expansion & Cross-Architecture Simulation](./lesson11-riscv-expansion/README.md)**
    Learn how the virtmcu framework expands beyond ARM to support RISC-V, allowing for heterogeneous multi-node simulations and architecture-agnostic platform descriptions.

*   **[Lesson 11.2: Virtual-Time-Aware Timeouts](./lesson11.2-virtual-time-timeouts/README.md)**
    Understand why wall-clock timeouts fail in slaved-icount mode and how `QmpBridge` uses `query-replay` icount to switch between virtual-time and wall-clock timeout sources automatically.

*   **[Lesson 11.3: Remote Port Co-Simulation (Path B)](./lesson11.3-remote-port/README.md)**
    Learn how to perform full TLM-2.0 co-simulation via the industry-standard AMD/Xilinx Remote Port protocol to support Verilated FPGA fabrics and high-bandwidth SoC subsystems.
